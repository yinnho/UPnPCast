## 🔄 Migration Guide

### For Existing Users
**No breaking changes!** Simply update your dependency:

```gradle
dependencies {
    implementation 'com.github.yinnho:UPnPCast:1.1.0'
}
```

All existing code will continue to work without modifications.

### Recommended Updates
While not required, consider these optimizations:

```kotlin
// Enhanced error handling
DLNACast.search(timeout = 5000) { devices ->
    if (devices.isNotEmpty()) {
        updateDeviceList(devices)
    }
}

// Better resource management
override fun onDestroy() {
    super.onDestroy()
    DLNACast.release() // Now more efficient
}
```
